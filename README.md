# FooBar

A week or so ago, I received an invitation to participate in Google's FooBar, if you don't know what that is, here you go:

> Google Foobar is Googleâ€™s secret hiring challenge. Google uses this to hire some of the best developers around the globe which they think can be a good match for their organization. Many developers in Google have been hired through this hiring challenge.
> 
> &mdash; From <cite> [Things you should know about Google FooBar Invitation][taom] </cite>

I don't expect much to come out of this, but I thought it sounded like fun so here we are, this repository contains my submissions. You'll also find a README in each problems' folder which will (probably poorly) explain my thought process.

As FooBar requires, the project uses Java 8. I personally run IntelliJ Community so everything has been tested there.
If you want to run the project, you can find `main` in `src/com/avnnn/foobar/FooBar.java`.

Sometimes, I use external python scripts to help me out (to generate tests for example), those are lost to time.

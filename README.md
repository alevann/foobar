# FooBar

FooBar is a challenge created by Google, it's made up of different levels and each time you have to solve increasingly complex problems. This repository contains the solutions I submitted.

The project uses Java 8, I personally run IntelliJ Community so everything has been tested there.
If you want to run the project, you can find `main` in `src/com/avnnn/foobar/FooBar.java`.

Sometimes, I use external python scripts to help me out (to generate tests for example), those are lost to time.
